  NewSentence:
  - "I\u2019m really proud of some of these illustrations, my drawing is definitely
    getting better.  \r"
  - "The human eye can view color via the cones cells in the retinas.  \r"
  - The cones work best in bright light, while the rod cells work better in dim light.
  - "Im trying to persevere and replicate some of the old anatomy diagrams. \r"
  - I wonder when this stopped being work and became my hobby?
