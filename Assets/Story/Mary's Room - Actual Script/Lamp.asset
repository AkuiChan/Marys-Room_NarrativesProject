  NewSentence:
  - Light is electromagnetic radiation within the spectrum that can be perceived
    by the human eye.
  - "The wavelengths a human can perceive range from 390 nm to 700 nm. \r"
  - When the light hits an object, the intensity of the wavelengths is what determines
    the objects color.
