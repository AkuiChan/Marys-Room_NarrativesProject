  NewSentence:
  - "Im currently reading \u201CPhysiology on Extraordinary Color Vision\u201D"
  - As many animals perceive color differently to humans, we may never know what
    they experience.
  - An example could be a bee, they have three spectral types of photoreceptors,
    similar to humans.
  - But while a human may see a flower as yellow, a bee will see patterns based on
    Ultraviolet light.
  - We can describe this, but cant experience it.
  - 'So do we really understand it? '
